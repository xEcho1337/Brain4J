**Brain4J** is a powerful, lightweight, and easy-to-use Machine Learning library written in Java, designed for speed and simplicity.

## Getting Started

When building a neural network, you have many options. In this example, we will create a neural network to simulate an XOR gate.

### Defining the Model

To represent an XOR gate, we can use a simple neural network with four layers:

```java
Model network = new Model(
        new DenseLayer(2, Activations.LINEAR),
        new DenseLayer(4, Activations.RELU),
        new DenseLayer(4, Activations.RELU),
        new DenseLayer(1, Activations.SIGMOID)
);
```

### Compiling the Model

Next, define the weight initialization method and the loss function for training. Use the compile method as follows:

```java
network.compile(WeightInitialization.HE, LossFunctions.BINARY_CROSS_ENTROPY, new Adam(0.001));
```

For models with a single output neuron (producing values between 0 and 1), Binary Cross Entropy is the recommended loss function, paired with the Adam optimizer.

Also, when using the ReLU activation function it's suggested to use the `He` weight initialization for better results.

### Preparing Training Data

Create your training dataset using DataSet and DataRow:

```java
DataRow first = new DataRow(Vector.of(0, 0), Vector.of(0));
DataRow second = new DataRow(Vector.of(0, 1), Vector.of(1));
DataRow third = new DataRow(Vector.of(1, 0), Vector.of(1));
DataRow fourth = new DataRow(Vector.of(1, 1), Vector.of(0));

DataSet training = new DataSet(first, second, third, fourth);
```

### Training the Model

Once the setup is complete, use the fit method inside a loop to train the network. Training stops when the error is below a certain threshold.

	Tip: Always split your dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.

```java
double error;

do {
    network.fit(training, 1);
    error = network.evaluate(training);
} while (error > 0.01);
```

The above code trains the neural network with a learning rate of 0.001, stopping when the error falls below 1%.
